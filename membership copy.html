		    		<h2>STAY HEALTHY & SAVE</h2>
		    			<p>Those with an eligible Medica, Health Partners, Preferred One, or Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota insurance plan are able to receive a monthly reimbursement for active participation. Simply visit one of our RecWell facilities at least 8-12 times per month (dependent on your plan) and enjoy $20 reimbursement to your checking or savings account.</p>
		    		<h2>WELLNESS POINTS</h2>
		    			<p>In addition to earning a $20-monthly reimbursement, U of M staff can also accumulate from 75-125 points per year for your Wellness Points. The points earned from October 2015 - July 2016 can be used the following year (2017) to reduce the cost of UPlan Medical Program coverage for members and their spouses. For more information about the Wellness Points program, visit the Employee Wellness Program page.</p>
		    		<h2>REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS</h2>
		    			<p>Monthly $20 reimbursements will be directly deposited (via an electronic funds transfer) into qualifying members' personal checking or savings accounts. There will be a 1-2 month delay between the month during which a member exercises and the month in which he or she receives the reward. For example, members completing the required number of visits in February will have their participation validated in March and will have their accounts credited in late March or early April. If a member fails to visit the required amount of times* during a month, the payment of future rewards will adhere to this schedule as well.
						<BR>*Note: monthly visit requirements vary depending on the type of insurance plan an individual is enrolled in.</p>
